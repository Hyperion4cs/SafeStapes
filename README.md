# SafeSteps
Semester project at EURECOM: This project allows a blind person to orient themselves in space with a camera and a raspberry pi. The primary goal of the project is to move in a corridor separated by two red lines. Obstacles are distributed on the road, the user is penalized when he walks on a square and he is rewarded when he walks on a cross.
